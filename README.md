# FileParsing
- Given a transcript file, this program creates a condensed transcript file and a summary file. 
  - The condensed transcript stores the names of speakers and how long they spoke.
  - The summary file stores statistics of the transcript, including how many times they switched, the number of people, the average time spoken by each speaker, etc.
